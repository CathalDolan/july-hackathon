### Project goals
The goal of this project is to create an application that allows customers of the local coffee shop to order coffee and snacks for collection. Users will be available to make a decision to pay for order online or in store. The website has to allow the customers to make a quick purchase of the favourite drinks without having to go through a lot of content first.
